# Machine-Learning-Project->01
# Rock vs Mine Prediction
This project leverages machine learning to classify objects detected by sonar signals as either rock or mine (metal cylinder). The classification is based on a dataset of frequency-based features collected from sonar returns, providing a robust foundation for developing and evaluating predictive models.

# Key Highlights
+ Dataset: Sonar Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
+ Objective: Accurately distinguish between rocks and mines using sonar signal data.
. Methodology:
+ Data preprocessing, including feature scaling and train-test splitting.
+ Implementation of classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
+ Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
+ Tools & Libraries: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

# Results
The trained model achieved a high classification accuracy and demonstrated effective differentiation between sonar echoes from rocks and mines.

This project highlights the application of machine learning in analyzing sonar data and lays the groundwork for further exploration of advanced algorithms or real-time sonar signal analysis systems.
